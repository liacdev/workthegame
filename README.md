Work: The Game! v0-0-1

Welcome to WTG Industries!

Congratulations!  Your training is now complete!  As a new employee, you'll be expected to perform a series of menial tasks and obey company policies like all of the other drones.

You will be offered an employee handbook.  You are encouraged to read the employee handbook thoroughly and refer to it often.  Failure to do so may diminish your chances of success in our fine company!

If you are successful at work, the company will make huge profits using your best ideas, though you probably will not earn much at all.  

Failure to be successful may result in a series of disciplinary actions to include: verbal warnings, a slap on the wrist, demerits, loss of dignity, shaming, embarrassment, written warnings, physical assault, imprisonment, *termination, or depending on the severity of the offense, possible summary defenestration.  

Fortunately, you cannot get fired.  

We hope you will enjoy working for our company as much as we plan to enjoy your company here at our company.   

Donâ€™t forget to read your employee handbook, and remember, we have **free donuts on Friday! 

* Text correction: extermination
** The new employee (that's you) brings the donuts.  Don't forget!!
